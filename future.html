          <h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Brandon Giella, a <a href="http://blog.brandongiella.com">writer</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12684601-brandon-giella">reader</a>, <a name="editor">edtior</a>, typographer, and designer based in Charlotte, NC.

    			<p class="intro">I work full-time as a copy editor, but I’m also taking on projects for editing and publishing. With an undergraduate degree in creative writing and a master’s degree in theology, I’m able to shape anything from a book of poetry to a PhD dissertation. <span>More</span></p>

    			<p>I have crafted projects ranging from books, articles, dissertations to web content and newsletters. If you have a manuscript or a website you need proofread, re-worked, or criticized, we can work together. I know that dissertation you’ve been working on for five years is more precious to you than some family members, so I take my time and ask lots of questions throughout the process.</p>
    			<p>Editing to me is an art form, where a craftsman shapes and sculpts a sentence with style and syntax. It’s also a silent art, since no one sees the work of an editor. No one remembers the guy that suggested to Rodin, “Maybe a little more somber here.”</p>
    			<p>I’ve also discovered that copy editing needs to be coupled with something else—namely, typography and design. Many design websites are poorly copy edited, but many copy editors have poor aesthetic taste. These two go together like crabs and legs. Or cakes, maybe.</p>
					<p>For style guides, I typically follow the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> 16th edition, Bryan Garner’s <em>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</em>, and Steven Pinker’s <em>The Sense of Style</em>, among a few others.</p>
					<p>Prices depend on the size of the project and detail required. A high school English paper is one thing, while a dissertation on the intertextuality of late-eighteenth-century British literature is quite another. Because of the scope, style, language, medium, and other aspects of a given project, pricing is always an estimate until I’ve reviewed it. Generally, though, I follow the rates of the <a href="http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php">Editorial Freelance Association</a>.</p>

    		<h1>Typographer</h1>
    			<p class="intro">Once a project has been properly copy edited, it’s ready to be typeset. Using InDesign, I can set the text into a block or book to give it a professional layout. This will then be ready to publish to PDF, EPUB, Kindle’s KF8, or any other e-reader. <span>More</span></p></p>

    		<h1>Designer</h1>
    			<p class="intro">How will people find these projects? I can create a simple, custom web page, using custom CSS and HTML, to house the publications (or anything else for that matter). I also do some hand lettering and logos, using Illustrator and Photoshop, if you need a whole brand package. If you want to go the extra mile, I can take photos for you too.</p>
